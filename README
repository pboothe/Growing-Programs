Most intro books totally suck.  We are trying to make one that doesn't suck,
based on the idea that to solve a programming problem, the right way of
creating a solution is to create a solution to a simpler problem and grow that
code by adding features and altering it, while continually making sure it still
compiles and runs, until the code is capabale of solving the original problem
set out for it.
